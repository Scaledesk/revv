                        For example:<br>
                        If your annual subscription fee is Rs. 2,40,000 (incl. taxes), and you return the car after 7 months of usage, you would have already paid Rs 1,40,000 (=7 months * 240000/12) in the monthly subscription fee payments In addition, you would have paid Rs 35,000 in monthly maintenance fee (=Rs 2 per km * 2500 Kms per month * 7 months),<br> and annual insurance cost of Rs 55,000. Thus, the total payment made by you till the end of 7 months would be Rs 2,30,000 (= 1,40,000 + 35,000 + 55,000) Now, if the monthly fee for the “by the month” option for the same plan is Rs 35,000 (incl. taxes), your total bill for 7 months would be re-estimated to Rs 2,45,000 (=35,000 * 7)<br> The difference between the above 2 is Rs 15,000, which will be deducted from your security deposit, and the balance would be refunded to you within 7 days of ending your subscription.</p>

Most States will require the car to stop at the border RTO station to pay the relevant tolls/taxes.<br> All Switch cars are equipped with original copies of the RC Card, Insurance Note, Self-Drive License, and the All India Permit, which will help you get through this conveniently. For many states, the state entry tax can be paid online as well, which your dedicated concierge can help you with.</p>
